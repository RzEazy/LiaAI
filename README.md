# LiaAI — 0.3.0

LiaAI has evolved into a modular, LLM-powered cyber-OS assistant with three core capabilities:

1. **Natural Language Chat** - General conversation and assistance
2. **OS Command Execution** - Safe execution of system commands
3. **Osquery Security Engine** - Security questioning and system forensics

## 🏗️ System Architecture

LiaAI follows a modular, chain-based architecture that separates concerns and enables extensibility. The system consists of several interconnected components that work together to process user input and generate appropriate responses.

### Component Design

#### Core Modules (`core/`)
- **IntentRouter**: Classifies user input into appropriate processing chains
- **MemoryManager**: Manages conversation history and context
- **SafetyChecker**: Validates commands and queries for security compliance

#### Processing Chains (`chains/`)
- **ChatChain**: Handles general conversation using LLM
- **OSCommandChain**: Converts natural language to safe OS commands
- **OsqueryChain**: Translates security questions to osquery SQL with RAG support

#### Execution Engines (`engines/`)
- **CommandEngine**: Safely executes OS commands with timeout protection
- **OsqueryEngine**: Executes osquery SQL statements and returns results

#### RAG Components (`rag/`)
- **VectorDB**: ChromaDB wrapper for document storage and retrieval
- **Retriever**: Finds relevant documentation for query context
- **Embedder**: Converts text to vector embeddings (handled by Cohere)
- **Ingestion**: Scripts to populate vector database with osquery documentation

#### Tools (`tools/`)
- **ResultFormatter**: Formats output for clean, readable presentation
- **SecurityDashboard**: Generates comprehensive security status reports

#### Utilities (`utils/`)
- **PromptTemplates**: Standardized prompt formats for consistency
- **Configuration**: Shared constants and configuration values

## 🔄 Workflow Process

1. **Input Reception**: User input is received through the CLI interface in `app.py`

2. **Context Retrieval**: 
   - MemoryManager retrieves conversation history and previous queries
   - Context is passed to subsequent processing steps

3. **Intent Classification**:
   - IntentRouter analyzes input using LLM classification
   - Determines appropriate processing chain (Chat, OS Command, or Osquery)

4. **Chain Processing**:
   - **Chat Chain**: Direct LLM processing for conversational queries
   - **OS Command Chain**: 
     * Converts natural language to system commands
     * Applies safety checks before execution
   - **Osquery Chain**:
     * Uses RAG to retrieve relevant osquery documentation
     * Generates SQL queries with contextual examples
     * Applies comprehensive security validation

5. **Execution**:
   - **Command Engine**: Executes validated OS commands with timeout protection
   - **Osquery Engine**: Runs validated SQL queries against system database

6. **Result Processing**:
   - SafetyChecker sanitizes output to remove sensitive information
   - ResultFormatter structures data for clean presentation
   - MemoryManager stores interaction for future context

7. **Response Delivery**: Formatted response is returned to user through CLI

### Data Flow Diagram

```
User Input → [Intent Router] → [Processing Chain] → [Execution Engine] → [Safety Check] → [Formatting] → User Output
     ↑              ↓                ↓                    ↓                 ↓              ↓              ↑
   Memory ← [Context Retrieval] → [RAG Retrieval] → [Query Generation] → [Validation] → [Presentation] → Memory
```

### RAG Pipeline

1. **Document Ingestion**:
   - Osquery table schemas fetched from GitHub specifications
   - Documentation parsed into structured format
   - Text converted to embeddings using Cohere
   - Stored in ChromaDB vector database

2. **Query-Time Retrieval**:
   - User input embedded using Cohere
   - Similarity search against document vectors
   - Top-k relevant documents retrieved
   - Documents injected into LLM prompt context

3. **Enhanced Generation**:
   - LLM generates SQL with relevant table/column context
   - Examples from documentation guide proper syntax
   - Reduced hallucination through grounded retrieval

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Install osquery:
   ```bash
   # Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt-get install osquery
   
   # macOS
   brew install osquery
   
   # Windows
   Download from https://osquery.io/downloads
   ```

3. Set up RAG database:
   ```bash
   # Navigate to the ingestion directory
   cd rag/ingestion
   
   # Run the ingestion scripts to populate the vector database
   python ingest_commands.py
   python ingest_osquery.py
   
   # Copy the database to the main application directory
   cp -r data/chroma_db/* ../../data/chroma_db/
   ```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Collection Does Not Exist Error
If you encounter "Collection [osquery_docs] does not exist" errors:
1. Ensure you've run the ingestion scripts in `rag/ingestion/`
2. Verify that the database files were copied from `rag/ingestion/data/chroma_db/` to `data/chroma_db/`
3. Check that the ChromaDB service is running and accessible

### Database Path Issues
The application and ingestion scripts must use the same database path. The default path is `data/chroma_db/` relative to the project root.

### Module Import Errors
If you encounter import errors when running ingestion scripts:
```bash
# Run from the project root with PYTHONPATH set
cd /path/to/LiaAI
PYTHONPATH=. python rag/ingestion/ingest_osquery.py
```

## ▶️ Usage

Run the application:
```bash
python app.py
```

Then interact with LiaAI using natural language:

### Chat Examples
- "Hello, how are you?"
- "What can you help me with?"

### OS Command Examples
- "Create a folder called projects"
- "List all files in the current directory"
- "Show me the disk usage"

### Osquery Examples
- "Show me all running processes"
- "What network ports are listening?"
- "Are there any suspicious login attempts?"
- "List all users on this system"
- "Show me recently modified files"
