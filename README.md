LiaAI is nothing but a simple yet advance beginner's project.
The project is launched using ```python3 app.py```. `pip install cohere` is used to install the cohere in your local system.



After doing so, you can finally start the program.
*Note: This is just the alpha stage of this project. It is not even properly patched. So, don't get your hopes too high.*

peace...!
